# scripts/validate

Static validation scans, wired to npm scripts. Each must FAIL loudly (exit 1, named
violations) on breach and proves its own detection with a self-test fixture run.

- `no-unauthorized-effects.mjs` (P3, `npm run validate:authority`) — proves (a) only
  `src/worker/effects/executor.ts` performs external-effect execution (no other worker
  file marks `external_effect_request` EXECUTED; no outbound fetch to non-localhost
  anywhere in worker code) and (b) merge/reverse + executor call sites route through
  `authorize()` and consume receipts. `--self-test` feeds synthetic violating sources
  through the same checks and asserts they are caught. The npm script also runs the
  seed generator's `--check` (registry-seed freshness) — see `scripts/seed/`.
